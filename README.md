# modern_cpp_design

Some code inspired by the book [Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Design-Generic-Programming-Patterns/dp/0201704315)

This is my personal playground with my own modifications.

For the original coide check the [book repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/files/Source%20Code/Modern%20C%2B%2B%20Design/).


Some examples use the original Loki library version 0.1.7.


[Download Here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/)


Simply extract the archive under the loki-0.1.7 folder.
